  abstract = {The Message Passing Interface Forum (MPIF), with participation from over 40 organizations, has been meeting since November 1992 to discuss and define a set of library standards for message passing. MPIF is not sanctioned or supported by any official standards organization. The goal of the Message Passing Interface, simply stated, is to develop a widely used standard for writing message-passing programs. As such the interface should establish a practical, portable, efficient and flexible standard for message passing. , This is the final report, Version 1.0, of the Message Passing Interface Forum. This document contains all the technical features proposed for the interface. This copy of the draft was processed by LATEX on April 21, 1994. , Please send comments on MPI to mpi-comments@cs.utk.edu. Your comment will be forwarded to MPIF committee members who will attempt to respond.}

    abstract = { Many software mechanisms for geophysics exploration in oil and gas industries are based on wave propagation simulation. To perform such simulations, state-of-the-art high-performance computing architectures are employed, generating results faster with more accuracy at each generation. The software must evolve to support the new features of each design to keep performance scaling. Furthermore, it is important to understand the impact of each change applied to the software to improve the performance as most as possible. In this article, we propose several optimization strategies for a wave propagation model for six architectures: Intel Broadwell, Intel Haswell, Intel Knights Landing, Intel Knights Corner, NVIDIA Pascal, and NVIDIA Kepler. We focus on improving the cache memory usage, vectorization, load balancing, portability, and locality in the memory hierarchy. We analyze the hardware impact of the optimizations, providing insights of how each strategy can improve the performance. The results show that NVIDIA Pascal outperforms the other considered architectures by up to 8.5×. }
