Problem is anisotropic with tilted transversely isotropy using sigma=0.750000
Grid size is (250,250,250) with spacing (1.00,1.00,1.00); simulated area (249.00,249.00,249.00) 
Grid is extended by 25 absortion points and 4 border points at each extreme
Wave is propagated at internal+absortion points of size (300,300,300)
Source at coordinates (154,154,154)
Will run 300 time steps of 1.000000 to reach time 300.000000
Sequential execution with OpenMP directives enable
OpenACC directives disabled
Recomended maximum time step is 0.000055; used time step is 1.000000
File TTI.rsf contains time evolution of (0:307,0:307,0:307)
