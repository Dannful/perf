Problem is anisotropic with tilted transversely isotropy using sigma=0.750000
Grid size is (250,250,250) with spacing (1.00,1.00,1.00); simulated area (249.00,249.00,249.00) 
Grid is extended by 25 absortion points and 4 border points at each extreme
Wave is propagated at internal+absortion points of size (300,300,300)
Source at coordinates (154,154,154)
Will run 300 time steps of 1.000000 to reach time 300.000000
Execution with OpenMP directives on 8 threads
OpenACC directives disabled
Recomended maximum time step is 0.000055; used time step is 1.000000
File TTI.rsf contains time evolution of (0:307,0:307,0:307)
