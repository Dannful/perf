Problem is anisotropic with tilted transversely isotropy using sigma=0.750000
Grid size is (100,100,100) with spacing (1.00,1.00,1.00); simulated area (99.00,99.00,99.00) 
Grid is extended by 10 absortion points and 4 border points at each extreme
Wave is propagated at internal+absortion points of size (120,120,120)
Source at coordinates (64,64,64)
Will run 300 time steps of 1.000000 to reach time 300.000000
Execution with OpenMP directives on 2 threads
OpenACC directives disabled
Recomended maximum time step is 0.000055; used time step is 1.000000
File TTI.rsf contains time evolution of (0:127,0:127,0:127)
